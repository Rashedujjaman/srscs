# Login Testing Guide

## Overview

The login system now supports **role-based authentication** with automatic redirection to the appropriate dashboard based on user role (Citizen, Contractor, or Admin).

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Updated Login Screen** (`login_screen.dart`)

- ‚úÖ Added `AuthService` integration to check user role after login
- ‚úÖ Improved error messages for different Firebase Auth errors
- ‚úÖ Added role-based dashboard redirection
- ‚úÖ Shows role in success message (e.g., "Login Successful as Admin")
- ‚úÖ Better error handling for invalid credentials

**Error Messages:**

- `user-not-found` ‚Üí "No user found with this email."
- `wrong-password` ‚Üí "Incorrect password. Please try again."
- `invalid-email` ‚Üí "Invalid email format."
- `user-disabled` ‚Üí "This account has been disabled."
- `invalid-credential` ‚Üí "Invalid credentials. Please check your email and password."

### 2. **Created Splash Screen** (`splash_screen.dart`)

- ‚úÖ Automatically checks if user is already logged in
- ‚úÖ Fetches user role from Firestore
- ‚úÖ Redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role
- ‚úÖ Shows loading animation during check
- ‚úÖ Handles edge cases (user with no role, auth errors)

### 3. **Updated Main.dart**

- ‚úÖ Added splash screen as initial route (`/`)
- ‚úÖ Imported splash screen component
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded citizen dashboard redirect

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Test Accounts in Firestore

You mentioned you've already created admin and contractor accounts. Ensure they have this structure:

**Admin Collection** (`admins/{userId}`)

```json
{
  "email": "admin@test.com",
  "fullName": "Admin User",
  "role": "admin",
  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}
```

**Contractor Collection** (`contractors/{userId}`)

```json
{
  "email": "contractor@test.com",
  "fullName": "Test Contractor",
  "phoneNumber": "01712345678",
  "assignedArea": "Dhaka",
  "isActive": true,
  "createdBy": "adminUserId",
  "createdAt": "timestamp",
  "role": "contractor"
}
```

**Citizen Collection** (`citizens/{userId}`)

```json
{
  "email": "citizen@test.com",
  "fullName": "Test Citizen",
  "nid": "1234567890",
  "phoneNumber": "01712345678",
  "address": "Test Address",
  "role": "citizen"
}
```

### Step 2: Test Login Process

   - Redirects to: Admin Dashboard (/admin/dashboard)

4. **Test Contractor Login**

   ```
   Email: contractor@test.com
   Password: [your password]
   ```

   - Expected: "Login Successful as Contractor"
   - Redirects to: Contractor Dashboard (/contractor/dashboard)

5. **Test Citizen Login**
   ```
   Email: citizen@test.com
   Password: [your password]
   ```
   - Expected: "Login Successful as Citizen"
   - Redirects to: Citizen Dashboard (/dashboard)

### Step 3: Test Auto-Login (Persistent Session)

1. After successful login, close the app
2. Reopen the app
3. **Expected:**
   - Splash screen appears

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Account not found" after successful authentication

**Solution:** Make sure the user document exists in the correct Firestore collection:

- Admin ‚Üí `admins/{userId}`
- Contractor ‚Üí `contractors/{userId}`
- Citizen ‚Üí `citizens/{userId}`

The `userId` must match the Firebase Auth UID.

### Issue: Stuck on splash screen

**Possible causes:**

1. Network connection issues
2. Firestore security rules blocking read access
3. User document doesn't exist

**Debug steps:**

1. Check Flutter console for errors
2. Verify Firestore security rules allow read access
3. Check if user document exists in correct collection

### Issue: Wrong dashboard after login

**Cause:** User document might be in wrong collection

**Solution:** Verify the user document is in the correct collection based on their role.
