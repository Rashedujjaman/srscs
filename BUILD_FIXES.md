# üîß Build Fixes for Push Notifications

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Core Library Desugaring Error ‚úÖ

**Error:**

```
Dependency ':flutter_local_notifications' requires core library desugaring to be enabled
```

**Solution:**
Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true  // ‚Üê Added this
}
```

Added dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")
}
```

### 2. BigLargeIcon Ambiguous Reference ‚úÖ

**Error:**

```
error: reference to bigLargeIcon is ambiguous
both method bigLargeIcon(Bitmap) in BigPictureStyle and method bigLargeIcon(Icon) in BigPictureStyle match
```

**Solution:**
Updated `flutter_local_notifications` version in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
# Before
flutter_local_notifications: ^16.3.0

# After
flutter_local_notifications: ^17.2.3
```

This newer version is compatible with Android SDK 35 and resolves the ambiguous method reference.
