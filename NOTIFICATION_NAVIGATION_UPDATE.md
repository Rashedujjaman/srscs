# Notification Navigation Update - Role-Based Routing

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Updated the notification navigation system to properly handle role-based routing for all user types (Citizens, Contractors, and Admins). The system now correctly routes users to appropriate screens based on their role and the notification type.

## Problem Statement

### Previous Issue

- Admin users receiving chat notifications from citizens were incorrectly redirected to the citizen dashboard
- The notification service was only configured for citizen use cases
- No role differentiation in notification navigation logic
- Generic routing that didn't account for user roles

### Root Cause

The `_handleNotificationNavigation` method in `notification_service.dart` used hardcoded routes without checking the user's role, causing all users to be routed to citizen-specific screens.

## Solution Implementation

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Updated `_handleNotificationNavigation` Method**

- **File:** `lib/services/notification_service.dart`
- **Changes:**
  - Added user role detection using `AuthService().getUserRole(userId)`
  - Implemented role-based routing logic for all notification types
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

#### 2. **Enhanced Notification Type Handling**

Based on the Cloud Functions in `functions/index.js`, the following notification types are now properly handled:

##### A. **Complaint Notifications**

| Notification Type  | Sender | Recipient          | Admin Navigation    | Citizen Navigation  | Contractor Navigation     |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `complaint_status` | System | Citizen/Contractor | N/A                 | `/track-complaints` | `/contractor/tasks`       |
| `new_complaint`    | System | Admin              | `/admin/complaints` | N/A                 | N/A                       |
| `task_assigned`    | System | Contractor         | N/A                 | N/A                 | `/contractor/task-detail` |

##### B. **Chat Message Notifications**

| Notification Type               | From       | To                 | Admin Navigation                         | Citizen Navigation | Contractor Navigation |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `admin_chat_message`            | Admin      | Citizen/Contractor | N/A                                      | `/chat`            | `/contractor/chat`    |
| `user_chat_message`             | Citizen    | Admin              | `/admin/chat/detail` (with userId)       | N/A                | N/A                   |
| `admin_contractor_chat_message` | Admin      | Contractor         | N/A                                      | N/A                | `/contractor/chat`    |
| `contractor_chat_message`       | Contractor | Admin              | `/admin/chat/detail` (with contractorId) | N/A                | N/A                   |
| `chat_message` (legacy)         | Various    | Various            | `/admin/chat`                            | `/chat`            | `/contractor/chat`    |
| `admin_reply` (legacy)          | Admin      | Various            | `/admin/chat`                            | `/chat`            | `/contractor/chat`    |

##### C. **Notice & Alert Notifications**

| Notification Type | Recipient | Admin Navigation   | Citizen Navigation | Contractor Navigation   |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `urgent_notice`   | All Users | `/admin/dashboard` | `/dashboard`       | `/contractor/dashboard` |
| `notice`          | All Users | `/admin/dashboard` | `/dashboard`       | `/contractor/dashboard` |
| `emergency`       | All Users | `/admin/dashboard` | `/dashboard`       | `/contractor/dashboard` |
| `news`            | Citizens  | `/admin/dashboard` | `/dashboard`       | `/contractor/dashboard` |

#### 3. **Enhanced Payload Encoding/Decoding**

Updated the payload handling methods to properly encode and decode all notification data fields:

```dart
/// Encode data to string payload (supports all notification data fields)
String _encodePayload(Map<String, dynamic> data) {
  return data.entries
      .where((e) => e.value != null) // Filter out null values
      .map((e) => '${e.key}=${Uri.encodeComponent(e.value.toString())}')
      .join('&');
}

/// Decode string payload to data map (supports all notification data fields)
Map<String, dynamic> _decodePayload(String payload) {
  Map<String, dynamic> data = {};
  for (String pair in payload.split('&')) {
    List<String> parts = pair.split('=');
    if (parts.length == 2) {
      data[parts[0]] = Uri.decodeComponent(parts[1]);
    }
  }
  return data;
}
```

**Improvements:**

- Added URI encoding/decoding for special characters
- Filter out null values to prevent encoding issues
- Support for all data fields from Cloud Functions (userId, contractorId, userType, complaintId, etc.)

## Navigation Flow Examples

### Example 1: Admin Receives Chat Message from Citizen

**Scenario:** A citizen sends a message to admin

1. **Cloud Function:** `onChatMessage` (functions/index.js)

   - Detects `isAdmin: false` (message from citizen)
   - Sends notification to all admins with:
     ```javascript
     {
       type: 'user_chat_message',
       userId: 'citizen-user-id',
       userType: 'citizen',
       messageId: 'msg-123'
     }
     ```

2. **Admin Device:** Receives notification

   - Taps notification
   - `_handleNotificationNavigation` is called
   - Detects user role: `UserRole.admin`
   - Matches notification type: `user_chat_message`
   - Navigates to: `/admin/chat/detail` with arguments:
     ```dart
     {
       'userId': 'citizen-user-id',
       'userType': 'citizen'
     }
     ```

3. **Result:** ✅ Admin is taken to the specific citizen's chat conversation

### Example 2: Citizen Receives Reply from Admin

**Scenario:** Admin replies to a citizen's message

1. **Cloud Function:** `onChatMessage` (functions/index.js)

   - Detects `isAdmin: true` (message from admin)
   - Sends notification to citizen with:
     ```javascript
     {
       type: 'admin_chat_message',
       userId: 'citizen-user-id',
       messageId: 'msg-456'
     }
     ```

2. **Citizen Device:** Receives notification

   - Taps notification
   - `_handleNotificationNavigation` is called
   - Detects user role: `UserRole.citizen`
   - Matches notification type: `admin_chat_message`
   - Navigates to: `/chat`

3. **Result:** ✅ Citizen is taken to their chat screen with admin

### Example 3: Admin Receives New Complaint Notification

**Scenario:** A citizen submits a new complaint

1. **Cloud Function:** `onComplaintCreated` (functions/index.js)

   - Sends notification to all admins with:
     ```javascript
     {
       type: 'new_complaint',
       complaintId: 'complaint-789',
       complaintType: 'Water Supply',
       priority: 'high'
     }
     ```

2. **Admin Device:** Receives notification

   - Taps notification
   - `_handleNotificationNavigation` is called
   - Detects user role: `UserRole.admin`
   - Matches notification type: `new_complaint`
   - Navigates to: `/admin/complaints`

3. **Result:** ✅ Admin is taken to the complaints management screen

### Example 4: Contractor Receives Task Assignment

**Scenario:** Admin assigns a complaint to a contractor

1. **Cloud Function:** `onComplaintAssigned` (functions/index.js)

   - Sends notification to contractor with:
     ```javascript
     {
       type: 'task_assigned',
       complaintId: 'complaint-101',
       complaintType: 'Road Repair',
       priority: 'high'
     }
     ```

2. **Contractor Device:** Receives notification

   - Taps notification
   - `_handleNotificationNavigation` is called
   - Detects user role: `UserRole.contractor`
   - Matches notification type: `task_assigned`
   - Navigates to: `/contractor/task-detail` with arguments:
     ```dart
     {'complaintId': 'complaint-101'}
     ```

3. **Result:** ✅ Contractor is taken to the specific task detail screen

## Testing Checklist

### Chat Notifications

- [x] Admin receives message from citizen → Routes to `/admin/chat/detail` with userId
- [x] Admin receives message from contractor → Routes to `/admin/chat/detail` with contractorId
- [x] Citizen receives message from admin → Routes to `/chat`
- [x] Contractor receives message from admin → Routes to `/contractor/chat`

### Complaint Notifications

- [x] Admin receives new complaint notification → Routes to `/admin/complaints`
- [x] Citizen receives status update → Routes to `/track-complaints`
- [x] Contractor receives task assignment → Routes to `/contractor/task-detail`

### Notice & News Notifications

- [x] Admin receives urgent notice → Routes to `/admin/dashboard`
