# 🎯 Role-Based System Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

## ✅ What Has Been Done

### 1. Architecture Planning

Created comprehensive plans in `/docs`:

- **ROLE_BASED_SYSTEM_PLAN.md** - Complete system architecture and requirements
- **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step implementation guide with code examples

### 2. Domain Models Updated

- **ComplaintEntity** - Added assignment tracking fields:

  - `area` - Location/area name for assignment
  - `assignedTo` - Contractor ID
  - `assignedBy` - Admin ID who assigned
  - `assignedAt` - Assignment timestamp
  - `completedAt` - Completion timestamp
  - `contractorNotes` - Notes from contractor

- **ComplaintModel** - Updated Firestore serialization with all new fields

### 3. Core Infrastructure Created

#### Role Management (`lib/core/constants/user_roles.dart`)

- `UserRole` enum (citizen, contractor, admin)
- `UserRoleExtension` with utilities:
  - Display names, colors, icons
  - Permission checks (canAssignComplaints, canUpdateComplaintStatus, etc.)
  - Role-based UI customization
- `AvailableAreas` class with Bangladesh cities
- `ComplaintStatus` enum with display helpers

#### Role Utilities (`lib/core/utils/role_helper.dart`)

- `RoleHelper` class with:
  - Dashboard routing by role
  - Route access validation
  - Navigation items per role
  - Role badge widgets
  - Permission checking system
  - Contractor data validation
  - Statistics label customization

### 4. Contractor Module Created

#### Domain Layer

- `ContractorEntity` (`lib/features/contractor/domain/entities/contractor_entity.dart`)
  - Core contractor properties (email, phone, area, etc.)
  - Creation tracking (createdBy admin)
  - Active/inactive status

#### Data Layer

- `ContractorModel` (`lib/features/contractor/data/models/contractor_model.dart`)
  - Firestore serialization
  - fromFirestore/toFirestore methods
  - copyWith method for updates

## 🔄 Complaint Assignment Workflow

```
1. Citizen submits complaint
   ↓
2. Complaint stored with area/location
   ↓
3. Admin views pending complaints
   ↓
4. Admin selects complaint
   ↓
5. System shows contractors in that area
   ↓
6. Admin assigns to contractor
   ↓
7. Contractor receives notification
   ↓
8. Contractor views in dashboard
   ↓
9. Contractor updates status
   ↓
10. Contractor marks as completed
   ↓
11. Citizen & admin notified
```

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### Firestore Collections

**complaints** (updated):

```javascript
{
  area: string,              // NEW
  assignedTo: string,        // NEW (contractor ID)
  assignedBy: string,        // NEW (admin ID)
  assignedAt: timestamp,     // NEW
  completedAt: timestamp,    // NEW
  contractorNotes: string,   // NEW
  // ... existing fields
}
```

**contractors** (new):

```javascript
{
  email: string,
  fullName: string,
  phoneNumber: string,
  assignedArea: string,
  createdBy: string,         // admin ID
  createdAt: timestamp,
  isActive: boolean,
  role: 'contractor'
}
```

**admins** (new):

```javascript
{
  email: string,
  fullName: string,
  role: 'admin',
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### Realtime Database (enhanced):

```javascript
chats: {
  "citizen-admin-{citizenId}": {
    participants: [citizenId, adminId],
    participantRoles: {
      citizenId: "citizen",
      adminId: "admin"
    },
    messages: {}
  },
  "contractor-admin-{contractorId}": {
    participants: [contractorId, adminId],
    participantRoles: {
      contractorId: "contractor",
      adminId: "admin"
    },
    messages: {}
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Ready to Implement)

### Phase 2: Services (Week 1-2)

1. **Create ContractorService** (`lib/services/contractor_service.dart`)

   - createContractor()
   - getAllContractors()
   - getContractorsByArea()
   - toggleContractorStatus()
   - updateContractorArea()

2. **Create AssignmentService** (`lib/services/assignment_service.dart`)

   - assignComplaint()
   - reassignComplaint()
   - markComplaintCompleted()
   - getUnassignedComplaintsByArea()
   - getContractorComplaints()

3. **Update AuthService**
   - Add getUserRole() method
   - Role-based routing after login

### Phase 3: UI Screens (Week 2-3)

#### Admin Screens

1. **Contractor Management**

   - `contractor_list_screen.dart` - View all contractors
   - `create_contractor_screen.dart` - Create new contractor
   - `contractor_detail_screen.dart` - View/edit contractor

2. **Assignment System**

   - `assignment_screen.dart` - Assign complaints to contractors
   - Filter by area, drag & drop assignment

3. **Enhanced Dashboard**
   - `admin_dashboard_screen.dart` - Full system overview

#### Contractor Screens

1. **Dashboard**
   - `contractor_dashboard_screen.dart` - View assigned tasks
2. **Task Management**
   - `assigned_tasks_screen.dart` - Active tasks
   - `task_detail_screen.dart` - Update status, add notes
   - `completed_tasks_screen.dart` - Task history

### Phase 4: Security (Week 3-4)

1. Update Firestore security rules
2. Update Realtime Database rules
3. Test role-based permissions

### Phase 5: Migration (Week 4-5)

1. Create default admin account
2. Migrate existing users (add role field)
3. Test with production data

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Test Accounts to Create

```
Admin:
- Email: admin@srscs.com
- Password: [secure]
- Role: admin

Contractor:
- Email: contractor@test.com
- Password: [secure]
- Area: Dhaka-North
- Role: contractor

Citizen:
- Email: citizen@test.com
- Password: [secure]
- Role: citizen
```

### Test Scenarios

- [ ] Citizen can register and submit complaints
- [ ] Admin can create contractor accounts
- [ ] Admin can assign complaints to contractors
- [ ] Contractor can view only assigned complaints
- [ ] Contractor can update status
- [ ] Contractor can mark as completed
- [ ] Chat works for all roles
- [ ] Permission system prevents unauthorized access

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Single App Architecture**

   - One Flutter app handles all roles
   - Role-based routing and UI customization
   - Better maintenance than separate apps

2. **Permission System**

   - Backend (Firestore rules) enforces permissions
   - Frontend (UI) hides unavailable features
   - Double-layer security approach

3. **Contractor Creation**

   - Only admins can create contractors
   - Contractors cannot self-register
   - Ensures quality control

4. **Area-Based Assignment**

   - Complaints tagged with area
   - Contractors assigned to specific areas
   - Enables efficient task distribution

5. **Chat Architecture**
   - Separate chat rooms per role combination
   - Admin can chat with citizens and contractors
   - Contractors can only chat with admin

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After implementation, the system should support:

- ✅ Multiple user roles with distinct permissions
- ✅ Contractor account creation by admins
- ✅ Efficient complaint assignment by area
- ✅ Role-based dashboards and navigation
- ✅ Secure access control
- ✅ Scalable architecture for future roles

- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step code examples
- Firebase documentation for security rules
