## üìä Monitoring Tools

### **Firebase Console - Realtime Database**

**Path to check:**

```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database ‚Üí Data

Check these paths:
- chats/{userId}/chatStatus/isViewing
- contractor_chats/{contractorId}/chatStatus/isViewing
- admin_chat_status/{userId}/isViewing
```

**Expected values:**

- `true` = User is viewing chat
- `false` or `null` = User is not viewing chat
- `lastSeen` = Timestamp of last status update

### **Firebase Console - Cloud Functions Logs**

**Path to check:**

```
Firebase Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs

Filter by function name:
- onChatMessage
- onContractorChatMessage
```

**Look for these log messages:**

```
‚úÖ "User is currently viewing chat, skipping notification"
‚úÖ "Admin is currently viewing chat with {userId}, skipping notification"
‚úÖ "Contractor is currently viewing chat, skipping notification"
üì¨ "Sending notification to [number] devices"
```

### **Flutter Debug Console**

**Print statements to look for:**

```
üì± Chat viewing status set: true (UserRole.citizen)
üì± Chat viewing status set: false (UserRole.citizen)
üì± Admin viewing status set for abc123: true
üì± Admin viewing status set for abc123: false
‚ùå Error setting chat viewing status: [error]
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Still getting notifications while chatting**

**Possible causes:**

1. Viewing status not set to true
2. Cloud Functions not deployed
3. Database permissions issue

**Debug steps:**

1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database
   - Is `isViewing` set to `true`?
   - Does the path exist?
2. Check Cloud Function logs
   - Are functions checking viewing status?
   - Are there any errors?
3. Check Flutter debug console
   - Are status updates being printed?
   - Are there any errors?

### **Issue: Not getting notifications after closing chat**

**Possible causes:**

1. Viewing status not cleared on dispose
2. App lifecycle not handled correctly

**Debug steps:**

1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database
   - Is `isViewing` set to `false` or deleted?
2. Check Flutter code
   - Is `dispose()` calling `_setChatViewingStatus(false)`?
   - Is `WidgetsBindingObserver` properly implemented?

### **Issue: Notifications inconsistent**

**Possible causes:**

1. App lifecycle state changes not handled
2. Multiple instances of chat screen

**Debug steps:**

1. Check `didChangeAppLifecycleState` implementation
2. Verify only one chat screen is open at a time
3. Check for duplicate database writes
