## 🔄 What Changed

### **Before Cleanup:**

```
❌ Function 5: onAdminChatReply      → Admin sends to citizen
❌ Function 6: onCitizenChatMessage  → Citizen sends to admin
✅ Function 7: onContractorChatMessage → Contractor sends to admin
```

### **After Cleanup:**

```
✅ Function 5: onChatMessage (MERGED) → Handles BOTH directions for citizens
✅ Function 6: onContractorChatMessage → Contractor sends to admin
```

---

## 💡 The Merged Function

### **`onChatMessage` - Bidirectional Chat Handler**

**Path:** `chats/{userId}/messages/{messageId}`

**Smart Logic:**

```javascript
if (messageData.isAdmin === true) {
  // Admin sent message → Notify Citizen/Contractor
  // Searches citizens first, then contractors
  // Sends to all devices of that user
} else {
  // Citizen/Contractor sent message → Notify All Admins
  // Gets user name from Firestore
  // Sends to all admin devices
}
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **120+ lines of code removed**
- ✅ **Single function** handles both directions
- ✅ **Multi-device support** built-in
- ✅ **Checks notification preferences** for both parties
- ✅ **Better error logging** with emojis for clarity

## 📂 Database Structure

### **Citizen Chats:**

```
chats/
  {userId}/
    messages/
      {messageId}:
        message: "Hello admin"
        timestamp: 1698400000000
        isAdmin: false  ← Determines notification direction
```

### **Contractor Chats:**

```
contractor_chats/
  {contractorId}/
    messages/
      {messageId}:
        message: "Task completed"
        timestamp: 1698400000000
        isAdmin: false
```

**Why separate paths?**

- Different security rules
- Different UI handling
- Potential future features (task-specific contractor chats)
