# 🔐 Logout FCM Token Cleanup Fix

## Problem

Users were still receiving notifications after logging out because the FCM token was not being deleted from the device.

## Root Cause

The logout methods in various screens were only calling `FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut()` without cleaning up the FCM token, so Firebase could still send notifications to the device.

## ✅ Changes Made

### Files Updated

#### 1. **`lib/core/routes/route_manager.dart`**

- Added import: `NotificationService`
- Updated `logout()` method to delete FCM token before sign out

```dart
Future<void> logout(BuildContext context) async {
  try {
    // Delete FCM token from current device
    await NotificationService().deleteToken();
    print('✅ FCM token deleted on logout');
  } catch (e) {
    print('⚠️ Error deleting FCM token on logout: $e');
  }

  await _auth.signOut();
  Navigator.pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
    context,
    AppRoutes.login,
    (route) => false,
  );
}
```

#### 2. **`lib/features/profile/presentation/screens/profile_screen.dart`**

- Added import: `NotificationService`
- Updated logout confirmation to delete FCM token

```dart
if (confirm == true) {
  try {
    // Delete FCM token from current device before logout
    await NotificationService().deleteToken();
    print('✅ FCM token deleted on logout');
  } catch (e) {
    print('⚠️ Error deleting FCM token on logout: $e');
  }

  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
  Get.offAllNamed(AppRoutes.login);
}
```

#### 3. **`lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/splash_screen.dart`**

- Added import: `NotificationService`
- Updated error handling logout to delete FCM token

```dart
if (userRole == null) {
  // User authenticated but no role found
  try {
    await NotificationService().deleteToken();
  } catch (e) {
    print('⚠️ Error deleting FCM token: $e');
  }
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
  Get.offAllNamed(AppRoutes.login);
  return;
}
```

#### 4. **`lib/features/auth/presentation/screens/login_screen.dart`**

- Added import: `NotificationService`
- Updated login error handling to delete FCM token

```dart
if (userRole == null) {
  // User authenticated but no role found in any collection
  try {
    await NotificationService().deleteToken();
  } catch (e) {
    print('⚠️ Error deleting FCM token: $e');
  }
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
  _showError("Account not found. Please contact administrator.");
  setState(() => _isLoading = false);
  return;
}
```

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### Before Fix

```
User logs out → Only Firebase Auth sign out
               → FCM token remains in Firestore
               → Device still receives notifications ❌
```

### After Fix

```
User logs out → Delete FCM token from Firestore array
               → Delete FCM token from Firebase Messaging
               → Firebase Auth sign out
               → Device stops receiving notifications ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case 1: Normal Logout

1. **Login on Device 1**
   - Check Firestore: Should see 1 token in `fcmTokens` array
2. **Logout from Profile Screen**
   - Check console logs: Should see "✅ FCM token deleted on logout"
   - Check Firestore: `fcmTokens` array should be empty
3. **Send test notification** (change complaint status)
   - Device 1 should NOT receive notification ✅

### Test Case 2: Multi-Device Logout

1. **Login on Device 1 and Device 2**
   - Check Firestore: Should see 2 tokens in `fcmTokens` array
2. **Logout from Device 1**
   - Check Firestore: Should see only 1 token (Device 2)
   - Device 1 stops receiving notifications
   - Device 2 continues receiving notifications ✅

### Test Case 3: Error Handling

1. **Simulate logout with network error**
   - Token deletion fails gracefully (try-catch)
   - User is still logged out
   - Token will be cleaned up on next login via `cleanupInactiveTokens()`

---

## 🔍 Logout Locations

All logout paths now clean up FCM tokens:

1. ✅ **RouteManager.logout()** - Used by:

   - Admin Dashboard logout button
   - Contractor Dashboard logout button
   - Any screen using `context.logout()`

2. ✅ **Profile Screen** - Logout button with confirmation dialog

3. ✅ **Splash Screen** - Error handling when user has no role

4. ✅ **Login Screen** - Error handling when role not found

## 📊 Token Cleanup Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  User Logs Out  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ NotificationService().deleteToken() │
└────────┬────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ├─► Get current FCM token
         │
         ├─► Find user's collection
         │   (citizens/contractors/admins)
         │
         ├─► Get fcmTokens array
         │
         ├─► Remove current device's token
         │
         ├─► Update Firestore
         │
         └─► Delete token from Firebase Messaging
```

## 💡 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Try-Catch Blocks**: Logout still works even if token deletion fails
2. **Logging**: Clear console logs for debugging
3. **Multi-Device Support**: Only removes current device's token
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed token deletion doesn't block logout
5. **Consistent Pattern**: Same cleanup logic in all logout paths

---

## 🚀 Deployment

No additional deployment steps needed beyond the app rebuild:

```bash
flutter run
# or
flutter build apk --release
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Logout from profile screen → No notifications received
- [ ] Logout from dashboard → No notifications received
- [ ] Multi-device: Logout from one device, other device still works
- [ ] Check Firestore: Token array updates correctly
- [ ] Check console logs: Success messages appear
- [ ] Network error handling: Logout still works
